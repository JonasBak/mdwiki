## Instructions

Press the <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> button in the upper-right corner to create a new page. The file has to be a markdown file, and end with ".md". When the filename contains directories, like "foo/bar.md", the folder "foo" will be created, as well as the file "foo/README.md".

Press the <i class="fa fa-edit"></i> button to edit the current page.
